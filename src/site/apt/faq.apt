FAQ

* Features

 <<Can I change the certificate for the HTTPs connection?>>
 
 Unfortunately, not yet. You have to configure the HTTPs connection manually. Open the default Eclipse Jetty Launcher Context files in the 
 Options tab to get a glue how to do this. 


* Common Problems

 <<When launching, the JVM fails with an java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:>>
 
 You may need another JRE/JDK. Jetty 6 and Jetty 7 run with Java 1.5. Jetty 8 needs at least Java 1.6 and Jetty 9 needs Java 1.7. 
 
 <<The application fails with an java.lang.ClassNotFoundException:>>
 
 You may need to tweak the dependency settings in the Dependencies tab.

 When using M2E, you can alter the default include/exclude options
 per scope or manually add dependencies. Are there dependencies without a scope? If yes, you may need the check the "Without Scope" option.
 Are you using a JNDI datasource? You may then need to load the database driver with the System classloader by checking the "Global" checkbox
 for the dependency. 
 
 <<My Servlet 2.5 Annotations do not work!>>
 
 First of all you need to enable <<JNDI and Annotations Support>> in the <<Options>> tab and next you have to make sure, that you are using
 Jetty 9 (highly recommendet) or prior to that, a Jetty Hightide dirstibution (you can find one on the {{{http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/}Codehaus Site}}).
